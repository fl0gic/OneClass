## Info

OneClass is an application that attempts to unify the numerous applications that students use on a daily basis into one user-friendly app.

It is currently in heavy development with very little to show for itself beyond a account creation page.

## Services

Right now I'm hoping to make OneClass work with the following services:
- [InfiniteCampus](https://www.infinitecampus.com/)
- [Schoology](https://www.schoology.com/)
- [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)
